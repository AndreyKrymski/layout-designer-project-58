### Hexlet tests and linter status:
The first project is a landing page describing common cognitive biases in programming. These are the most common problems that many developers face at various points in their careers. How to deal with them and what they are, you will learn from the landing page and will be able to help more people learn about it. After all, the landing page will not be stored on your computer, but you will put it on an available hosting and everyone will be able to see it through your link.
